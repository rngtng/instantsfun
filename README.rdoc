= InstantsFun Standalone
a simple (dirty) wrapper to fire the instantsfun.es sound with your Launchpad OR Keyboard easily

== Usage
Have you ever visited http://instantsfun.es ? No? You should! It's full of must-have sound samples to cheer up you live! Too sad you only can fire those via mouse which suckz! But here come help.

Launch *InstantsFun Standalone* which fires the sound using your {Novation Launchpad}[http://www.novationmusic.com/products/launchpad?option=1]. Yay!

== Technical Stuff
Ok, I have to admit, this is a very quick dirty hack and could have be done way more elegant & efficient. But I didn't wanted to touch/modify/scrape the original website at all. So I came up with this simple wrapper. 
t's basically a processing app which embeds a MozillaBrowser using {MozSwing}[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mozswing/] and connects to you Launchpad using my {Processing Launchpad Library}[http://rngtng.github.com/launchpad/]. On button pressed, a simple javascript command is send to the embedded browser to trigger the sound. That's it!


== ToDo
* optimize on file size
* better keyboard support
* better layout
